## About Me

Hi there! Hello, my name is Saymek, and I'm a beginner web developer at Mitt, which is in Canada. I'm now studying front-end programming languages including JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I'm eager to pick up a new skill that will support my career aspirations or help me land a job.

When I'm not coding, I prefer to unwind by watching movies and listening to music. I enjoy going to the park with my family on hot summer days to play board games or maybe hoops with friends. I also enjoy unwinding with video games after a demanding workday. I also enjoy dining at different restaurants and experimenting with new foods. Seeing what's out there is enjoyable!
